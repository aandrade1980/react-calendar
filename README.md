This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instalation

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn`

and

#### `yarn start`

to start the local server:

```
 http://localhost:3000/
```

If there was more time I would have liked to:

- Think out the Redux architecture a little more
- Improved UI, maybe add styled components or some react material ui
- Added drag and drop support to move reminders to other days

### Bugs

- It doesn't work for December because the weeksIndex is higher than the first of Jan
